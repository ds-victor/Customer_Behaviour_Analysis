# Key Insights – Customer Behavior Analysis

This document summarizes the main analytical findings from the transactional dataset.

---

## 1. **Revenue Concentration**

A small percentage of customers (top 10%) contribute a disproportionately large share of total revenue.  
This is typical of Pareto (80/20) behavior and indicates a need to retain high-value customers.

---

## 2. **Purchase Frequency Patterns**

Some customers place many orders, while a long tail of others place few.  
High purchase frequency usually correlates with higher lifetime revenue.

---

## 3. **Recency & Inactivity**

Using RFM metrics, we find that many customers have not purchased in the last several months.  
These inactive customers are potential re-engagement targets.

---

## 4. **Revenue by Country**

Revenue varies significantly across countries.  
Certain regions drive much of the business while others contribute little — useful for regional marketing focus.

---

## 5. **Customer Segmentation Opportunities**

Through segmentation based on revenue and frequency:
- **Champions**: High frequency & high revenue
- **Potential Loyalists**: Moderate frequency & revenue
- **Low Value**: Low frequency & low revenue
- **At-Risk**: High past revenue but low recent activity

This segmentation supports tailored retention campaigns.

## 6. **Business Impact**

From these insights, a data-driven strategy can be devised to:

- Reward high-value customers
- Design targeted promotions
- Reactivate inactive users
- Understand regional performance
